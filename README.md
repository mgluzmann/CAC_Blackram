# My first website

Blackram is a model website built for 2021 Argentinian goverment issued 4 month course called Codo a Codo: https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codo-codo. I used flex and grid for the layout and included a few CSS animation. Currently I work as an Automation Product Owner, so thought it would be nice making an Automation Consulting website as if I had my own business.
